## On-Demand Kubernetes Clusters for deploying PMM
Percona Platform now enables you to spin up a Kubernetes cluster, on demand. Use the **Launch a new cluster** option on the new **Free Kubernetes** tab to deploy a Kubernetes cluster with 3 nodes, 4 CPUs, 8 GB of RAM, and a three-hours lifespan. These short-lived clusters are perfect for testing PMM with DBaaS and Percona Operators.
For more information, see [Launch free Kubernetes clusters](create-free-k8.md).

## Option to delete your organization 
Administrator users can now delete their own organizations. User members of the organization can still use their Percona Accounts to log into Percona Platform and join or create other organizations.

    !!! hint alert alert-success "Tip"
        When deleting an organization, all organization data will be gone forever, so be cautious when performing this action. 

## Enhanced tickets view and pagination
We have made it easier to navigate long lists of tickets open for your organization. The **List of tickets open by Customer** section on the **Dashboard** page now includes pagination and the table is now sortable.

## Optimized account activation
Users invited to join an organization now receive all the relevant invite information in a single email. Previously, we would send an email for activating a Percona account and a separate one with information about the sender.
 
## Resend confirmation link
Invitation links to join an organization in Percona Platform expire after 7 days. Administrator users can now resend pending invitations to ensure that users who don't accept an invitation before the invitation link expires can still join the organization at a later time.

## More options to subscribe for Percona Platform updates
If you have registered for a Percona Platform account via Google or GitHub, you can opt-in for communications about Percona Platform and Services via the **Welcome to Percona Portal** pop-up that now shows up after logging in with your social account.
